# Level 1

When creating a lambda function with the console's GUI, choose all the default options except for:

- Function name
- runtime : nodejs
- create from scratch

Then use the editor in the browser to copy paste the code that is available in this repo, and be sure to click on the button "Deploy"

After that, click on the dropdown arrow beside "Test" and choose "Create a test event", there is where the event json could be customized, but for this helloworld function, it doesn't matter.

Once the test event is saved, you can test your function which is like sending a request to it.
